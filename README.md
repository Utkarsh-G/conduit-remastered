(Additional helpful notes can be found within the journals of the Counduit compendium pack under "Class Info + License".)

There are four major steps to enable all of the automation that the conduit class uses. Only step 1 is mandatory to enable the class.

1. Install the Conduit Remastered module in Foundry.
2. Enable the viewing of Conduit feats in compendium browser.
3. Get the PF2e Workbench module for its basic action macros.
4. Enable Resistance automation in the PF2e system settings in Foundry.

This document covers the first step.

### Manual Installation Guide

- Open Foundry.

- In the very first page, where you can see all your game worlds, select "Add-on Modules" on the top right.

- Select "Install Module" near the search bar.

- At the very bottom of the Install Module window, find the text entry box with the label "Manifest URL".

- Put the following url in that text entry bar:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Utkarsh-G/conduit-remastered/master/module.json

- Select "Install", which is to the right of where you entered the URL.

- Next, open up your PF2e game world.

- In the very top right, select the gear icon ("Game Settings").

- Under Game Settings, select "Manage Modules".

- Find "Conduit Remastered" and check the box to its left. 

- At the bottom of the window, select "Save Module Settings". This will cause the game window to refresh.

- That's it! Conduit Remastered module is now installed. If you go to the book icon in the top right ("Compendium Packs"), you will now see a folder labeled "Conduit".

- If you open the Conduit folder, you can select "Class Info + License". The journal entry titled "Guide for GMs with a Conduit PC" has the remaining steps to enable additional automation for the class.
